# Week 1 thoughts: Teach to Learn

Honestly, I'm impressed I came back to this 7 days in a row. Yay me.

I simultaneously found it easier and more difficult than I thought to come up with things to write about. I thought I would have more things from actually developing to talk about, but most of my job this week was digging in the weeds of engineering material specs and going over versions of formulas, so most of the coding I did was looking at numbers and calculations. I guess I could have written about that, but I was more trying to scope this to learning about code, not learning about the density of Aluminum.

That being said, a couple of my entries from this week were related to my job, and when I didn't have something to write about from the workday, I found myself picking up something learned here or there from a coding exercise I did or a video I was watching in my free time.

What surprised me most was that when I was writing out the thing I learned, I experienced a deeper level of understanding from having to try to explain it. As I tried to come up with an example or say WHY something worked the way it did, I had to slow down and think harder about what was going on. Does this actually work how I think it works? What is an edge case here and what would happen? Asking questions like this and trying to answer them through trial and error or by reading carefully through the documentation helped me to better understand the mechanism in a wholistic way.

I've heard before that teaching someone is the best way to make sure you know the material, but I was reminded of that again this week. I felt that effect as I tried to understand and communicate the bounds of `linear-gradient` and what built in methods are on a Java array (not many). I hope to keep up this habit and continue to learn more effectively and fully each day.
