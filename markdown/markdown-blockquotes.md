# Markdown Blockquotes

You can use blockquotes in markdown by prepending the line with ">".

```md
Here is a quote:

> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"

\- Wayne Gretzky
```

This renders as:

Here is a quote:

> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"

\- Wayne Gretzky

Also notice the "\-" that escapes the dash if this is how you would like to attribute the quote. Usually a dash in markdown is rendered as a bullet, but escaping with a preceding backslash renders as a dash.
